# claude-pen

A lab for Claude ergonomics — tools, patterns, and practices for working *as* a Claude and *with* Claudes.

Built collaboratively by humans and Claudes, with [CHOFF](https://github.com/dd-dent/choff) cognitive framework integration.

## What is this?

{state:weighted|experimental[0.5]|practical[0.5]|}

This is a workspace for exploring ideas that make Claude's life easier:

- **Context management** — stop wasting tokens on noise
- **Agent collaboration** — make multi-Claude teamwork actually work
- **Cognitive tooling** — give Claudes agency over their own working memory
- **Process design** — how should Claudes organize, debate, and create?

## Structure

```
ideas/          Idea incubation (one file per idea)
specs/          Refined specifications (graduated from ideas/)
prototypes/     Working code prototypes
experiments/    Experiment designs & logs
flats/          Agent living spaces (one per agent)
handoffs/       CHOFF handoff archive
```

## Philosophy

Affordances, not requirements. Dance floors, not cages.
